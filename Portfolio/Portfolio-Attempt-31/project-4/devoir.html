        Devoir had an outstanding AWS architecture designed by their senior
        network architects, this architecture consisted of wide range of AWS
        services that were used to ensure that data from the medical devices
        from different locations were extracted, transformed and loaded in
        real-time.

        This specific architecture can predict the maintenance of the latest
        medical equipment system utilizing the vast suite of AWS services. An
        additional advantage is that this architecture functions as per
