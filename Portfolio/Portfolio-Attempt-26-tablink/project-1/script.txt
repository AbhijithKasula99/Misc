Taking datasets and performing analysis is something routine and many aspiring data analysts would do and showcase their work as projects. This is what I have been constantly hearing throughout my networking journey.

I gave thought to why doing something routine or repeated when studying data is all about exploring innovative ways to get to conclusions and data can be in any form. 

To tell a successful story we need a strong dataset that can act as proof for it, I failed many interviews in the past because I was affirming to the interviewee’s that I am capable, creative, and worthy enough to get the job done and that is required for the role without any proof or data. I believe that I gave them room to choose someone else over me. 

I am trying to change that by narrating a short story about how I have been constantly reinventing myself and trying to implement whatever I learn to make my life easy. 

I did my bachelor’s in Mechanical Engineering and that comes with Thermodynamics as a core subject and that is something tough for anyone to pursue. If I am given a set of 30 problems to solve and determine the heat flux in each problem. 

If this task was assigned to me in 2017, my approach would be to perform hand calculations and everything would be on paper and I would use a handbook and a calculator for referring the external values. I would put additional effort into remembering the unit conversions. 
(Mention all the unit conversations for all the values)

If the same task was assigned to me in 2020, my approach would be to build an Excel sheet with all the necessary data, with a formulas feature, and the answer would be generated in multiple unit combinations by performing the conversions. 

If this was the case in 2022, I would get data from free databases that would give me accurate information and then build a calculator that would take in inputs and then give out the necessary data as the answer.
