# Kasulaverse

- This is the second attempt in making my portfolio, the last one was just made using HTML, I plan on learning and implementing CSS and JavaScript tools simultaneously and record my progress.

- As of 04/03/23, I realized that making a Three.js portfolio is kind of bit time consuming so did do my work and realized and settling for a portfolio with parallax effect and it is inspired by Front-End-Joe.
