        What would Kasula do?
      </h1>
      <p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="500" data-aos-easing="linear">
        Taking datasets and performing analysis is something routine and many
        aspiring data analysts would do and showcase their work as projects.
        This is what I have been constantly hearing throughout my networking
        journey.
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-delay="500" data-aos-easing="linear">
        I gave thought to why doing something routine or repeated when studying
        data is all about exploring innovative ways to get to conclusions and
        data can be in any form.
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-delay="500" data-aos-easing="linear">
        To tell a successful story we need a strong dataset that can act as
        proof for it, I failed many interviews in the past because I was
        affirming to the interviewee's that I am capable, creative, and worthy
        enough to get the job done and that is required for the role without any
        proof or data. I believe that I gave them room to choose someone else
        over me.

        I am trying to change that by narrating a short story about how I have
        been constantly reinventing myself and trying to implement whatever I
        learn to make my life easy.
      </p>
      <h3 data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="500" data-aos-easing="linear">
        Let me narrate you a story now!
      </h3>
      <p data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-delay="500" data-aos-easing="linear">
        I did my bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering and that comes with
        Thermodynamics as a core subject and that is something tough for anyone
        to pursue. If I am given a set of 30 problems to solve and determine the
        heat flux in each problem.
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="500" data-aos-easing="linear">
        If this task was assigned to me in 2017, my approach would be to perform
        hand calculations and everything would be on paper and I would use a
        handbook and a calculator for referring the external values. I would put
        additional effort into remembering the unit conversions.
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-delay="500" data-aos-easing="linear">
        If the same task was assigned to me in 2020, my approach would be to
        build an Excel sheet with all the necessary data, with a formulas
        feature, and the answer would be generated in multiple unit combinations
        by performing the conversions.

        If this was the case in 2022, I would get data from free databases that
        would give me accurate information and then build a calculator that
        would take in inputs and then give out the necessary data as the answer.
