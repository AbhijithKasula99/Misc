        Let's assume you are an Analyst at a real estate agency and you have
        access to huge set of listings, but you want to build something for the
        marketing team in such a way that the based on the clients requirements
        they can quickly filter the listings on sale and show the best ones that
        match their requirement.
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-delay="500" data-aos-easing="linear">
        They could have built out an application but the maintainence and
        development costs are not feasible for a newly started agency, so as an
        Analyst you have come up with idea to build a dashboard that has access
        to raw data of listings and filter the ones that would help the
        marketing team to show the best ones to the client.
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="500" data-aos-easing="linear">
        Now, a client is looking for a house that can be refurbished and listed
        on Airbnb for additional income, But the client has certain conditions
        to be metand those are budget range, house size, bedrooms and bathroom
        numbers.
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-delay="500" data-aos-easing="linear">
        Building a specific dashboard for that single client is not an efficient
        thing, We can build a dashboard that has specific region listings let's
        say Northeast coast as of now. We need to show listings that can fit in
        the price range, size, location and the state the client is looking for.
      </p>
      <p
        data-aos="fade-right"
        data-aos-delay="500"
        data-aos-easing="linear"
        id="out"
      >
        We can extract the data and filter the uneccessary data and then use the
        rest to visualize and create amazing filters. So the team can look up
        and revert back to the client as soon as possible.
